;; Exercise 2.22.  Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first square-list procedure of exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:

(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things) 
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items nil))
